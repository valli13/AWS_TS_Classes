# DATA MESH:

The four principles of data mesh define a new approach to data architecture comprised of domain-driven data ownership, data as a product, a self-serve data platform, and federated computational governance.
- Domain-oriented decentralization: Data ownership is decentralized to business domains, empowering teams to manage their data infrastructure independently for greater agility and accountability.
- Data as a product: Treating data as a product encourages teams to focus on quality and usability, ensuring that data meets the specific needs of consumers like any other product.
- Self-serve data infrastructure: Domain teams have autonomy over their data infrastructure, enabling faster innovation and iteration without relying on centralized resources.
- Federated data governance: Governance processes are decentralized to each domain, ensuring compliance and security while allowing flexibility to tailor governance to specific needs.

## BENEFITS:

Data Mesh allows organizations to scale their data infrastructure more effectively by decentralizing data ownership and processing. Data Mesh fosters collaboration and innovation by promoting the composability of data products and encouraging cross-domain interactions. While decentralizing data ownership, Data Mesh still maintains governance and compliance standards through federated data governance processes within each domain. With data mesh, every business division and team is empowered to use the data-as-a-product methodology to solve problems and add value. Data mesh is more efficient compared to traditional ETL pipelines using central IT Teams. Data mesh, using data-as-a-product, enables organizations to expose data to all domains. This empowers sharing and collaboration across teams. It also avoids duplication of effort and helps ensure agility. 

## CHALLENGES:

- Requires a robust change management strategy : To help manage the risks of the project, a thorough, concrete, and realistic change management strategy must be developed before deploying data mesh. 
- Integration with existing systems: Integrating Data Mesh with existing legacy systems and data architectures can be challenging. 
- Technical complexity: Decentralizing data infrastructure and adopting a microservices architecture can introduce technical complexity, especially around data integration, interoperability, and governance.
- Skills and expertise: Data Mesh requires domain teams to have the necessary skills and expertise to manage their own data infrastructure and products.

Some real-life examples of companies successfully implementing this approach:

- ING: This Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation has been embracing a decentralized, domain-oriented approach to their data management.
- Zalando: This e-commerce company implemented a domain-driven data platform that enabled domain teams to develop, test, and deploy their data products independently.
- Intuit: Introduced a domain-oriented team structure to manage their data operations, enabling independent product development teams to own and manage their own data platforms.
